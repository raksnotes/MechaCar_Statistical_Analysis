## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

vehicle_length & AWD

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No, as shown in the snapshot below, some p-values are significant which would mean to reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that the slope is not considered to be zero.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

This Linear Model predicts the mpg effectively because the R-Squared value = 0.7149033, in which the value is closer to 1.
